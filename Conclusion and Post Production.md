# SharkBase - Conclusion and Post Production
 
At first, when I saw the theme of the game, my first thought was to create a simple collect game in which players can use mouse control to go back and forth to collecting or eating fish. While I was brainstorming the idea, I decided to create a defensive tower base game. I still kept the main concept which is the shark eats the fish to collect points. The core machine is the player will be at the center game and eat all the fish that come near the house to protect its base. 

This game is focused on children from age 7-8 years old, game machines have to be simple and easy to play. As a result, I set up only two buttons A and D to control the character. To add the limitation for the game, I decided to also use the mouse control on top of the current controller to make it more challenging. Also, because of the target demographic,  I chose bright and colorful colors with some catchy sound effects to make the game more interesting and fun for children to play. 

There are many aspects that need to be implemented because the game is just a small prototype. The game needs to add more various types of enemies with colorful and good design.  the main shark need add more feature or particular effects or VFX to make the game more appealing to children. There is much room for implementing new features or improve the code and performance of the game.
